# mermaid-checker
Use this skill when the user asks for a Mermaid diagram or when your response includes a Mermaid code block. It validates and automatically fixes Mermaid syntax errors, ensuring LLMs generate syntactically error-free Mermaid code on their first attempt.

## usage
1. Navigate to the skills directory
2. `git clone github.com:strconv/mermaid-checker.git && cd mermaid-checker && npm install`
3. Ask the LLM directly: "Draw a diagram showing the TCP connection establishment process"
